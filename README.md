# MNMC Website

The main objective of this project was the practical application of knowledge and skills related to the technologies necessary for website development.

One of the features of this project is that it is an institutional website, and we chose a museum—specifically, the Museu Nacional de Machado de Castro. We decided it would be interesting to create a website for this type of institution, and during our research, we identified some shortcomings in the current website of the Museu Nacional de Machado de Castro that could be improved visually and in terms of clarity, making it simpler and more intuitive.

In fact, the most relevant information for a museum includes its location, history and mission, collections, exhibitions, pricing, opening hours, and the ability for users to communicate with museum staff. Therefore, these will be the key elements highlighted on the website.
